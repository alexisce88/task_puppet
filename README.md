I have used the module nginx already found on github at: https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-nginx/blob/master/docs/quickstart.md 

In order to complete the tasks I have created the manifest files task1 and task2 and the config files nginx_config.erb, forward_proxy.conf.erb and health_check.conf.erb
